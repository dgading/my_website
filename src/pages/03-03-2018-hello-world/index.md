I don't know how many of these I have written, but here we are again, the start of my new blog.  

This blog is going to be a playground for me to write about and show off some of my work. It will mostly be React and Drupal, with some Unreal and Unity stuff. I'm sure at some point I might help solve a problem or answer some question the internet didn't need solved or answered. 

The current stack for the site is [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) on a Digital Ocean server. I was using a headless Drupal build, but it was just too much maintenance for something I forget about for months on end. Everytime there were a number of security updates and other fixes needed. Now just some React and Markdown files. 

I've recently been using [Next.JS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) for a couple of SSR apps, so I added the [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) plugin to Gatsby for styling. I really like the state based interaction you can easily add to a component without needing to rewrite the template with [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) or making class updates trigger stylesheet changes. 

All the code for the site is stored on [Github](https://github.com/dgading/my_website). If you see any mistakes let me know on Twitter [@dgading](https://twitter.com/dgading) or open a PR and fix it for me. :)
